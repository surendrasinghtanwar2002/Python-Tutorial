# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

#Addition operator
a = 10
b = 20
print("Total of a & b is",a+b) #output 30

#Subtraction operator
c = 30
d = 20
print("Subtraction of c & d", c-d) #output 10

#Multiplication operator
e = 50
f = 45
print("Multiplication of two number is",e*f) #output 2250

#Division operator (Basically this operator give value in floating value)
g = 25
h = 5
print("Division of g & h", g/h) #output 5.0 (This operator give quotent of division)

#Modulus Operator
i = 750
j = 5
print("Modulus of i & j",i%j) #output 0 (This operator give division reminder o)

#Exponentiation Operator 
k = 25
l = 2
print("power of 25 is",k**l) #output 625 (This operator simply give the power of given no)

#Floor division operator
m = 85
n = 5
print("Floor division of m & n", m//n) #output 17 (This operator simply gives int value)
