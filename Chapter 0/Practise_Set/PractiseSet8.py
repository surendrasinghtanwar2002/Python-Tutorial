##Escape character being used to use illega string in the existing string
print("""This is my name section and here we can do anything""")

## To insert illegal character in the strings in the existing python we use escape character 
## It is being used by \ back slash 

print("My name is Surendra Singh Tanwar \"Double quote can be used\" inside a double quote")


## In this section we will practise more escape character in the python




##Other escape character which is being used in python

#\'	Single Quote
print("Hello my name is surendra \"illegal action:\"  ")

#\\	Backslash
print("Hello my name is \\(surendra)") #output Hello my name is \(surendra)

#\n new line
print("My name is surendra \n I live in Balotra \n My contact number is 9460824001")

#\r its carriage return which will return to first place at current line
print("\r My name is surendra")

#\t its being used to give tab space in the text
print("\t this is my name in the string surendra")

#\b this is backspace This example erases one character (backspace):
print("My name is surendra\b singh tanwar") #because if use /b without any space it will remove last character 
# because it's being designed to give backspace to the string
