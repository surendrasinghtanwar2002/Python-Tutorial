# This is practise set of assignment operator

#Making a calculator using this such operator which are being presented in the python

#adding this both variable number
A = 105
B = 5
sum = A+B
print("Sum of",A,"&",B,"is",sum)

#subtracting this both variable number
subtraction = A-B
print("Subtraction of this both number",A,"&",B,"is",subtraction)

#multiplication of this both variable number
multiplication = A*B
print("Multiplication of this both number",A,"&",B,"is",multiplication)

#division of this both variable number is 
division = A/B
print("Divison of",A,"&",B,"is",division)

#modulus operator of this both variable number to find the division reminder 
modulus = A%B
print("Reminder of",A,B,"is",modulus)

#exponential operator of this both variable to find the power of any number
expose = A**B
print("Power of",A,"with",B,"is",expose)

#floor divsion operator to find the reminder of the number without floating point number because whenver we divide the number we get output in the floating value
#so for solving that problem we use floor division value
floor = A//B
print("Floor division of",A,"&",B,"is",floor)
