# In this section we will practise various things of the python such as addition of two number


#Adding two operands using addition operator
a = 25
b = 35
c = a+b
print("The sum of two number is", c)


#Subtracting two operands using subtraction operator
A = 105
B = 25
C = A-B
print("The subtraction of two number is", C)

#Multiplication of two operands using multiple operator
First = 25
Second = 35
Multiplication = First*Second
print("The multiplication of two number is ", Multiplication, "and datatype is", type(Multiplication))

#Division of two operands using Division operator
firstno = 35
Secondno = 2
division = firstno/Secondno
print("Division of two number is ", division, "and datatype is" ,type(division))
