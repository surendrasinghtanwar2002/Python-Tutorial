#There are a lot of operators which are being presented in the python so here we will discuss about 
#the arithmetic operator

#First operator + or Addition operator \" Addition\"
a = 25
b = 36
sum = a+b
print("sum of", a ,"&", b,"is",sum)

#Second operator is - or Subtraction operator \"Subtraction\"
c = 1005
d = 35
left = c-d
print("subtraction of",c,"&",d,"is",left)

#Third operator is * or multiplication operator \"Multiplication\"
f = 35
g = 45
mult = f*g
print("Multiplication of",f, "&",g,"is",mult)

#Fourth operator is / or division operator \"Division\"
h = 10
i = 2
div = h/i
print("Divison of", h,"with", i,"is equal to", div)

#Fifth operator is ** exponential operator to find out the power of any number
k = 5
l = 3
total = k**l
print("Power of",k,"uppon",l,"is",total)

#Sixth operator is % or modulus operator which is being to find any division reminder
m = 21
n = 3
modul = m%n
print("Modulus of", m,"with",n,"is",modul)

#Seventh operator is a floor division operator which is being used to divide the number but not printing value in floating value
# result down to the nearest whole number
o = 105
p = 5
floor = o//p
print("Floor division of", o, "&",p,"is",floor)
